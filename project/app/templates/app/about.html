        My name is Arvydas Gasparavicius. I am self taught programmer/web-dev. Every day I spend time with computers (I have a few). I write some code, develop my current projects, tweak my emacs configuration, monitor scripts that I have created for businesses that elevate them from repetitive tasks and so on.
